# Docs generation demo

This is a demo of how to use the typescript compiler and ASTs to generate a [custom elements manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest) json for a web component file. This is an introductory demo and is by no means a complete solution.


### Scripts

To generate a json AST representation of the web component file, run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate-ast
```

To generate a custom elements manifest json file, run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate-manifest
```
