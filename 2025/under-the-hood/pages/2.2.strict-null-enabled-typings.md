# Public typings history

- Original code base all JavaScript
- Gradually adopted TypeScript (1.5) starting in 2015 (~400 kLoc of JavaScript)

# Public typings history

- First public release of 4.0 SDK in 2016, including TypeScript typings
- Majority of code base still in JavaScript (only 50 kLoc of TypeScript at this point)
- How to get the typings?
  - Cannot use the type declaration generation from the TS compiler
  - Write typings by hand?
  - Large API surface (20k lines of typings file)

<div v-click class="flex justify-center bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8">
Solution: generate typings automatically from the jsdoc
</div>

---

# Fast-forward

- Generated typings evolved over time
  - Support more complex constructs (multiple inheritance, generics, autocasting)
  - Link back to documentation (e.g. for intellisense in vscode)
- Generally has worked very well (e.g. most Esri developed apps against the JS SDK are in TS)
- But had two large issues (until this release)

<div v-click class="flex justify-center bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8">
  <ol>
    <li>Types did not include null or undefined types (needed for strict null compatibility)</li>
    <li>We kept finding small bugs and discrepancies between the types and implementation</li>
  </ol>
</div>

---

# Emit strict null compatible types

- Internal code base already uses strict null checks at this point üëç
- Main difficulties
  - Strict null checks is all or nothing, no gradual path (and code base is large)
  - Users rely on null/undefined types to be _correct_ (otherwise it defeats the purpose)
  - But, how can we have confidence it's correct? (since it's based on docs)

---

# Validate public typings against the code base

> üó£Ô∏è We kept finding small bugs and discrepancies between the types and implementation


- Simple idea, we use the TS compiler to validate the code base conforms to the public typings
  - Iterate over public type modules
  - Generate a "dummy" TS file that looks something like this
   ```ts
   import WebSceneInternal from "esri/WebScene";

   // ...embedded public typing definitions...

   // Validate implementation against interface
   const v1: WebSceneInternal = null!; v1 satisfies WebScenePublic;
   ```
  - Run TS compiler to figure out any type errors
- Main problem?
  - Internal code base has null/undefined types, but public typings do not!

---

# All together now

- Both problems need to be addressed at the same time
- Internally still done in steps
  1. Update the typings generator to automatically remove null/undefined types (unless opted in)
  2. Use a code mod to bulk update jsdoc to include null/undefined types based on TS type information
  3. Incrementally validate and fix public module types (in blocks of 50 modules, for ~1000 modules total)
  4. Add CI to use the validator to makes sure the committed fixed set of modules do not regress
- When all modules validate, emit null/undefined types in public typings and announce (4.32)

---

# Key takeaways

- Immediate pay off from doing validation (also catches public documentation errors)
- Improved development workflows (immediate feedback on jsdoc types)
- Commitment to TypeScript support
